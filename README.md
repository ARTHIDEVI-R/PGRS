FINAL YEAR PROJECT
#project Description
An online application is the Public Grievance Redressal System. 

The project is primarily designed to be used by members of the public to file complaints with different societal sectors.

Admin, User, and Head of Department (HOD) are the three users upon whom the project is based.

Theprimary goal of the user is to file a grievance.

The department heads to which users can file complaints can be assigned by the administrator.

The complaint will be resolved by the department head after it has been approved. 

Present-day residents encounter numerous challenges when attempting to voice their grievances to the authorities.

They must meet with higher officials face-to-face, which is a time-consuming process. 

People can file their grievances using this system rather than going directly to the source.

Key Skills: Python,HTML5 ,CSS3,JS,Flask, MySql (DB).
